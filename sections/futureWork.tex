\section{Future Work}\label{sec:future_work}
Due to the promising results provided by the modified pachinko model, investigating this model further might be beneficial to incorporating meta-data into topic models.
However, testing these model on multiple datasets, needed to be accounted for, since the generalizability of these models is not explored within this paper.
Using word embedding to further improve the performance of models can also be viewed as the next step for this project, since a wide number of papers are using this technique to improve topic modeling.


Using these models at Nordjyske, would also be very interesting to see, how we could incorporate them into a existing IT infrastructure.
The next step in that process, would be to investigate which part of their infrastructure could benefit from the use of topic modeling, whether it is recommendation or automatic tagging of articles. 
We have written about a few potential use cases for our project in \ref{sec:appendix_applications} in the Appendix.

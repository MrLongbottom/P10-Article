\section{Plate Notation}
As with \todo{ref author-topic model}, there is no document-topic distributions $\theta$, rather each author and category has their topic distribution.
This is based on the assumption that authors prefer to write about specific topics, and that categories of the articles were chosen based on the content of the finished article or that local newspapers have their own unique topic preferences.

Our model is a 'Upstream Model', meaning that topics are only word distributions and are chosen based on the data of the documents, rather than 'Downstream Model' where topics are fitted to have influence on both word distributions and other metadata.

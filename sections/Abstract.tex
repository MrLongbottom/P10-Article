Topic models are used to find underlying topics in a set of documents.
Integrating metadata into topic models can improve their performance.
We introduce models that extend the \gls{lda} to include author and category metadata information and a model which applies taxonomy metadata on the \gls{pam}.
The author-topic and category-topic models are based on the author-topic model with modifications, and the taxonomy-topic model is based on \gls{pam}.
To make the \gls{pam} include the metadata information, a novel topic locking mechanism is created.
The results show that for a news article dataset, our taxonomy-topic model integrates the metadata well and improves the elapsed time in comparison to the original \gls{pam}.
The taxonomy-topic model has a higher topic coherence and more understandable topics than \gls{lda}.
Our results show that integrating metadata can improve topic modeling in various ways.

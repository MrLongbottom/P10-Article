We introduce models that extend the \gls{lda} to include author and category metadata information and a third model which applies taxonomy metadata on the \gls{pam}.
The author-topic and category-topic models are based on the author-topic model from \citet{author_topic_2012} with slight modifications, and the taxonomy-topic model uses the \gls{pam} from \citet{li2006pachinko}.
To make the \gls{pam} include the metadata information in each layer of its \gls{dag} structure, a novel topic locking mechanism is created.
The results show that for the applied dataset, the author-topic and category-topic models get a lower topic coherence than \gls{lda}. \vejleder[inline]{focus on the good results rather than the bad}
However, the taxonomy-topic model has a higher topic coherence and more understandable topics than \gls{lda}.
For each model, we also give proposals for how they can be used for recommendation in a news article environment.

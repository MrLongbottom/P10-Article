We introduce models that extend the \gls{lda} to include author and category metadata information and a third model which applies taxonomy metadata on the \gls{pam}.
The author-topic and category-topic models are based on the author-topic model with slight modifications, and the taxonomy-topic model uses the \gls{pam}.
To make the \gls{pam} include the metadata information in each layer of its \gls{dag} structure, a novel topic locking mechanism is created.
The results show that for the applied dataset, our modified pachinko model integrates the meta-data well and improves the run-time.
However, the taxonomy-topic model has a higher topic coherence and more understandable topics than \gls{lda}.
For each model, we also give proposals for how they can be used for recommendation in a news article environment.

\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}
\gls{lda} is used to predict underlying topics within a corpus of text documents.
Previous extensions of \gls{lda} have included various other information such as authors, into the model, to generate better topics.
In this paper, we will research the effect that including various combinations of metadata information about documents will have on \gls{lda}.
These metadata include authors as well as higher level categorical information.
We will conduct \gls{lda} models using various combinations of these metadata and observe the effect of the topic generated.
We use a dataset of danish newspaper articles, and construct models that account for the specific metadata available for this dataset.

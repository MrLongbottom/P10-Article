The paper, above, initialize and describe our problem and is results focused.
Within this appendix, we are expanding on many aspects of the aforementioned paper.

This includes:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Overview
	\begin{itemize}
		\item A brief explanation of the process of training and evaluating our models.
	\end{itemize}
	\item Code
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The code for the Gibbs sampler is explained and the other models we explored are described in how they differ from the standard Gibbs Sampler. 
		Other versions of the models are also explained, such as a parallel Gibbs sampler.
	\end{itemize}
	\item Metrics 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item We explain the purpose and mathematical ideas behind the three evaluation metrics we use in the paper.
	\end{itemize}
	\item Modifications 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The specific modifications we have implemented into our models are evaluated and explain in detail.
	\end{itemize}
	\item Metadata
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The metadata is shown in tables, specifically for the author and category metadata, and observations about the metadata labels are described.
	\end{itemize}
	\item Applications
	\begin{itemize}
		\item We explore the application possibilities of our project and propose various applications which could be implemented at Nordjyske.
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

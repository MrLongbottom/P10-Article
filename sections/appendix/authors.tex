\subsubsection{Author Meta data}
There are a total of $227$ authors within the data set where each author on average have written $757$ from 2017 to 2019.
Other interesting fact that the median is $316$ which is much lower than the average which is visible in \autoref{fig:author_histogram}.
The minimum number of articles that have been written by an author is $1$ and the maximum number is $9906$.
When we look at the top two most writing authors, we get two people:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Ove NÃ¸rhave
	\begin{itemize}
		\item A well-known journalist, who have been at Nordjyske for over 25 years.
	\end{itemize}
	\item System Administrator
	\begin{itemize}
		\item This is either a bug or some articles where the author is not needed.
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

In \autoref{fig:author_histogram}, we see that the vast majority of authors have written under $2000$ articles within the three years.

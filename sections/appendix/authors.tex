There are a total of $227$ authors within the data set where each author on average have written $757$ from 2017 to 2019.
Other interesting fact about this meta data field is that the median is $316$ which is much lower than the average which is visible in \autoref{fig:author_histogram}.
The minimum number of articles that have been written by an author is $1$ and the maximum number is $9906$.

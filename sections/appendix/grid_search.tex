\subsection{Grid search}
We have run a grid search based on the standard model of the \gls{lda}, which allowed us to find an approximated optimal configuration.
During this gridsearch, we optimized for the best topic coherence measure after 50 epochs, which was the number of epochs where the gains started to diminish.

The five lowest values in \autoref{fig:visual_grid}, are where the $\alpha$ is $0.1$ and $\beta$ is $0.01$. 
This shows us that having the $\alpha$ high and the $\beta$ low does not yield good coherence results.
The next five values is where the $\alpha$ and $\beta$ is $0.01$, which also shows that low value in both hyper parameters does not yield the best results either.
There is a minor differences between the top configurations in \autoref{fig:visual_grid} but the top two configuration are $70$ and $90$ topics, where $90$ is the best.

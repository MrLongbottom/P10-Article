\subsection{\gls{lda} standard deviation}\label{sec:std_dev}
Since the \gls{lda} model uses a generative process, we see how confident the standard model is, in the resulting topic coherence.
We have run 10 models using the hyper parameters $K=90$, $\alpha=0.01$ and $\beta=0.1$.
Measuring the confidence of our Gibbs sampler, can be calculated by the standard deviation by using the results from the 10 models' topic coherence.
We calculate the standard deviation by:
\begin{equation}
	SD = \sqrt{\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i-\bar{x})^2}{n-1}}
\end{equation}
where $\mu = 0.535$, which is the mean of the 10 models.
The standard deviation for our \gls{lda} model is $0.0104$, which means that our model does not deviate much from the mean.

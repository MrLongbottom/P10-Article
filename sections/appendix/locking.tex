\subsection{Locking the gibbs sampler}\label{sec:appendix/locking}
The pachinko model normally samples, like the gibbs sampler, each taxonomy level and estimates the different topics for each document.
However, in our case, we have a partially observed variable and we want to use the existing meta-information to estimate the topics quicker and more accurately.
When we sample the pachinko, we only sample the unobserved variables and let the observed variable be. 
This has the effect of letting the unobserved variable fit the existing topics within the model and making the process of sampling faster.
However, when locking these variables into places also hinders further improvement to the observed variables, since they do not change during training.

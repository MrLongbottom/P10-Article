\subsection{Category and Author Pachinko}\label{app:cat_auth_pachinko}
Given the good results of the taxonomy \gls{pam}, we decided to test \gls{pam} with the two other metadata fields: Author and Category.
These metadata are not layered and can therefore not utilize the layered nature of \gls{pam} in the same way.
Instead, a four-layer \gls{pam} will be used, with a root layer, a metadata layer where words are locked into topics using the technique outlined in \autoref{sec:appendix/locking}, a layer with 90 'blank' topics, and a word layer.

As can be seen from the results in \autoref{tab:cat_auth_pachinko_results}, these models achieve better results than the previous author and category models and the \gls{lda} model.
However, the taxonomy \gls{pam} is still better overall.
The same conclusion is reached after manual inspection of the topics of these models.

\section{Related Work}

\citet{author_topic_2012} have developed an \gls{lda} model, called Author-Topic model, which incorporates the a list of authors for the original \gls{lda} model. 
They also show that the combination of authorship and \gls{lda} yield more coherent topics.


\citet{blei2010supervised} develop a Supervised \gls{lda} model which incoporates observed variables within a \gls{lda} model.

\citet{mimno2008topic} describes two general model patterns, called ''upstream`` and ''downstream`` models.
These patterns describe how topic models are created.

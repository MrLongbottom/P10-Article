\section{Dataset}
Nordjyske is a Danish news agency that maintains multiple newspapers, radios and other news sources throughout north Jutland, a region in Denmark.
They store their news articles in a non-public database, where each article contains multiple meta-data fields which describes some aspect of the data eg. author.
One of the metadata fields is the Category field, which both describes where the article is supposed to be located(within a newspaper) and also which subject the article is about.
These meta-data are very interesting in that they detail the data in certain ways which might be useful in some way.

In the following section, we describe each of the meta-data fields which are analysed.

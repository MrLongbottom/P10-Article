\section{Dataset}
Nordjyske is a Danish news agency that maintains multiple newspapers, radios and other news sources throughout north Jutland, a region in Denmark.
They store their news articles in a non-public database, where each article contains multiple meta-data fields which describes some aspect of the data eg. author.
One of the metadata fields is the Category field, which both describes where the article is supposed to be located(within a newspaper) and also which subject the article is about.
These meta-data are very interesting in that they detail the data in certain ways which might be useful in some way.

In the following section, we describe each of the meta-data fields which are analysed.

\subsection{Author}
This field mentions the author, who have written the article.
This field is fully observed within the dataset, which means that every article has an author.
There are $X$ different authors within the dataset and they are almost evenly distributed in the number of articles they have written.

\subsection{Category}
The category field describes a variety of different aspects. 
This field is fully observed within the dataset.
A proportion of the articles contains which specific newspaper, they belong to, eg. Aalborg-Newspaper.
Another proportion of the category fields describes the overall theme, such as culture and sports-newspaper.

\subsection{Taxonomy}
The taxonomy field describes a hierarchical structure of the topical or geographical subject of the articles.
This field is only partially observed within the dataset, which means that about $X\%$ articles contain this field.
We observe a pattern when referencing the topical or geographical structure of this field which is:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Places/Country/Town
	\item Topics/Sub Topic
\end{itemize}
